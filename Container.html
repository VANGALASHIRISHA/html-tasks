        <h2>Hyper Text MarkUp Language</h2>
        <p>
HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. It is the standard markup language used for creating web pages and web applications.
HTML is not a programming language; instead, it is a markup language. This means it uses a system of tags and elements to structure and define the content and layout of a web page. These tags provide instructions to web browsers on how to display the content, such as creating paragraphs, headings, lists, tables, embedding images, and linking to other resources.
Key aspects of HTML include:
Structure: HTML defines the logical structure of a web page, organizing content into meaningful sections.
Elements and Attributes: HTML documents are composed of elements, represented by tags (e.g., <p> for paragraph, <img> for image). Elements can have attributes that provide additional information about them (e.g., src attribute for an image's source).
Web Browsers: Web browsers interpret HTML code and render it visually for users.
Foundation of the Web: HTML forms the basic structure upon which other web technologies like CSS (for styling) and JavaScript (for interactivity) are built.
