    <h2 id="html">About HTML</h2>
 <p>HTML, or HyperText Markup Language, is the foundational language used to create and structure content on the World Wide Web. It is a markup language, not a programming language, meaning it uses a system of "tags" to define the different elements of a web page and how they should be displayed by web browsers.
HTML organizes text, images, links, and other media into a logical structure, forming the "bones" of any webpage. For example, a heading is defined with tags, a paragraph with tags, and an image with an tag. These tags, and many others, are interpreted by web browsers to render the visual layout and content of a website for users.</p>
    <h2 id="css">About CSS</h2> 
       <p>CSS, which stands for Cascading Style Sheets, is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in HTML or XML. It is a fundamental technology for web development, working in conjunction with HTML to create visually appealing and well-structured web pages. </p>
   <h2 id="js">About JAVA </h2>
        <p>Java is a high-level, object-oriented programming language and computing platform, initially released by Sun Microsystems in 1995 and now owned by Oracle. It is designed to be platform-independent, meaning that Java programs can run on any operating system or device that has a Java Virtual Machine (JVM) installed, embodying the "write once, run anywhere" principle.</p>

         <p>MySQL is an open-source relational database management system (RDBMS) widely used for storing and managing data. It is known for its speed, reliability, and ease of use, making it a popular choice for web applications and other data-driven systems. 
Key characteristics of MySQL include:
Relational Database: MySQL organizes data into structured tables with rows and columns, where relationships between tables can be defined using keys. This relational model helps in maintaining data integrity and efficient retrieval.
Open-Source: MySQL is freely available for use and modification under the GNU General Public License, fostering a large and active community of developers and users.
SQL-based: It utilizes Structured Query Language (SQL) for interacting with the database, allowing users to perform operations such as creating, modifying, retrieving, and deleting data.
Scalable and Performant: MySQL is designed to handle large datasets and high-traffic applications, offering features for optimization and scalability.
Cross-Platform Compatibility: It runs on various operating systems, including Windows, Linux, and macOS, providing flexibility for deployment.
Widely Used: MySQL powers a vast number of websites and applications, from small personal blogs to large-scale enterprise systems, and is a core component of the popular LAMP stack (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP/Python/Perl).</p>
